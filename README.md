# MLforIoT-CUBEMS
Contains the project repository for Energy Load Prediction using the CUBEMS dataset. This was a final project for a course titled "Machine Learning for Internet of Things". The poster used for the final presentation will also be provided.

The CUBEMS Dataset - linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claytonmiller/cubems-smart-building-energy-and-iaq-data
- Details energy load demands based on sensors placed across different floors of a building with seven stories.
- These sensors measure plug loads, ambient qualities (such as temperature, humidity), as well as even other characteristics such as illuminance levels (lux). This allows for multimodal data to be gathered for processing.
